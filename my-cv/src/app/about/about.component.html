    <p></p>
    <p class="text">I've never thought that once  I would decide to connect my life to information technologies. <br>
      I have an education and work experience in the sphere far enough from it.  <br> But one day I tried to solve one of my everyday work problems using programming. My first program was ugly, slow and totally hard coded - but it worked! <br>
      Then I realized â€“   this is something I actually want to do. I want to create <br>
      This is why I finished my more than 3 year journey in transport logistics and joined frontend course in rolling scope school. Here I found an amazing community of purposeful and inspired people as I am, met a great challenges,  deadline is and found out what a team development is. 
      I adore the feeling how my brain works. <br>
      How I had lived without all this stuff before?)

      <br>
      And now It's time for new challenges - I dream about my first job, where I can gain my skills, to be a part of real world project.

      Another very important fact about me - I Can't live without Nutella.</p>
